Chainlit Base
===========

Clone the repository from: https://github.com/DL4DS/dl4ds_tutor    

Change the branch to the `chainlit_base` branch.

Create a `.env` file, view `code/modules/constants.py` for the required environment variables.

Set required args in the `code/config.yml` and `code/modules/constants.py` files. 

Put your data under the `storage/data` directory. Note: You can add urls in the urls.txt file, and other pdf files in the `storage/data` directory.    

> Note: The 'WebpageCrawler' in `code/modules/helpers.py` takes in the urls from the `storage/data/urls.txt` file, and gets all children urls and files from the urls provided. If you want to read only the data in the urls provided, set `["embedding_options"]["expand_urls"]` to False in the `code/config.yaml` file.

To run the code locally:

To create the Vector Database, run the following command:   
```python code/modules/vector_db.py```    
(Note: You would need to run the above when you add new data to the `storage/data` directory, or if the ``storage/data/urls.txt`` file is updated. Or you can set ``["embedding_options"]["embedd_files"]`` to True in the `code/config.yaml` file, which would embed files from the storage directory everytime you run the below chainlit command.)

To run the chainlit app, run the following command:   
```chainlit run code/main.py```

See below for Docker instructions.

See the [docs](https://github.com/DL4DS/dl4ds_tutor/tree/main/docs) for more information.
