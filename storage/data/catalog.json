Through data modeling and visualization, students will  construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects  only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer  programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course  delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual  privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all  around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism,  entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they  gain in this class to enhance those interests. Not to mention a grounding for  students who want to pursue the field of data science itself.

            "course_abstract": "Society is becoming increasingly digitized and datafied. Important decisions impacting criminal justice, housing, finance, labor, healthcare, and education are frequently determined by or are aided by artificially intelligent algorithmic technologies that are built and trained on large datasets. The rise in these technologies presents a challenge for social justice. Though often presented as neutral decision aids, these technologies often produce harmful predictions that operate to reinforce old legacies of racial, class, gender, and heteropatriarchal subordination. Datafication practices, computational techniques, legal doctrine, and policy play a key role in facilitating these disparate outcomes. This course will center on the complicated relationship between social justice and data science. The course will introduce students to the historical and current role of datafication and computation practices in social subordination. Students will leave the course having developed the skill set needed to identify and critically engage with the social justice challenges posed by these new technologies",

We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine the computational approach. Students will work with published data and computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a critical review of a broader topic in the field.",

In this course, we look to explore how real- world constraints and  considerations like ethics and liability affect the  adoption of AI in real-world  applications. We focus on conversational systems  in various domains as the  running use case throughout the course to explore  various AI technologies from  the shallow models of the 2000s to the more recent  deep learning architectures.  Upon completion of this course, students will be  building different types of AI  models, and gain a deeper understanding of what  it takes to train, test, and  deploy AI-based applications in real-world  settings.",

It guides students through the  challenging transition into the graduate program in CDS by introducing them  to the variety of skills and capacities that are needed to succeed as a  scholar. 3. It engenders a sense of community amongst the group of students  entering the program as a cohort. 4 cr. Either sem.",

The  dynamic nature of AI systems requires a new set of skills informed by ethics, law, and policy to be  applied throughout the life cycle of such systems: design, development and deployment. It also  involves ongoing collaboration among data scientists, computer scientists, lawyers and ethicists.  Tackling these challenges calls for an interdisciplinary approach: deconstructing these issues by  discipline and reconstructing with an integrated mindset, principles and practices between data  science, ethics and law. This course aims to do so by bringing together students with diverse  disciplinary backgrounds into teams that work together on joint tasks in an intensive series of in- class sessions. These sessions will include lectures, discussions, and group work. This unique  course will bring together students from multiple institutions, each contributing undergraduate  students from either computing and data science disciplines or from law and public policy  disciplines.",
